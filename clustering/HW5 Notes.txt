I'm having trouble knowing when to stop the algorithm.  It doesn't seem to stop even when the SSE doesn't change.  If the SSE isn't changing, the centroids aren't moving.  I watched the SSE fall and the number of trials.  The SSE flattened before 30 trials. The SSE is just the sum of all the distances.  If the two are equal, it should be zero.  Where are they all going when they get stuck out and only some of the clusters get points.  What happens when there are no cluster.  I update the centroid with a random value if there aren't any clusters.  I changed it to see what happened.  The clusters converge, but sse is minimized when all the clusters have membership.

Want to try to pick membership by assigning initial to a random data point seed.  Not appreciably different SSE, but there are much fewer empty clusters.  (sometimes one)
